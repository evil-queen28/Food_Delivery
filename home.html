                    Gujarati cuisine is that of the state of Gujarat, in western India.

                    The typical Gujarati thali consists of rotli, dal or kadhi, rice, and shaak (a dish made up of
                    several different combinations of vegetables and spices, which may be either spicy or sweet). The
                    thali will also include preparations made from pulses or whole beans (called kathor in Gujarati)
                    such as moong, black eyed beans etc., a snack item (farsaan) like dhokla, pathra, samosa, fafda,
                    etc. and a sweet (mishthaan) like mohanthal, jalebi, doodh pak etc. Gujarati cuisine varies widely
                    in flavour and heat, depending on a family's tastes as well as the region of Gujarat to which they
                    belong. North Gujarat, Kathiawad, Kachchh, Central Gujarat and South Gujarat are the five major
                    regions of Gujarat that contribute their unique touch to Gujarati cuisine. Many Gujarati dishes are
                    distinctively sweet, salty, and spicy simultaneously. <br>

                    or Desi-Chindi cuisine is a distinct fusion culinary style which combines aspects of both Indian and
                    Chinese foods and flavours. Though the cuisines have mixed throughout history through the Silk Road
                    via Tibet, the most popular origin story of the fusion food resides with the Chinese of Calcutta,
                    who immigrated to colonial India looking for better prospects and better lives around 250 years
                    ago.Opening restaurant businesses in the area, these early Chinese immigrants adapted their culinary
                    styles to suit the tastes of their Indian patrons. <br>
